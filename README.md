# Snack Track
## (Name to be determined)

I am a serious snacker. I need to keep tabs on it so I don't over do it. Users can create a profile and keep a personal log.

Eventually, I want to incorporate Google Calendar API so user can see visually when they've snacked, count how many times in a day they snacked, and calorie count.

I also want to explore adding D3 to display calorie count or number of snacks per day in an interesting way.

## Technologies
### Server-side
- Node, Express, Auth, MongoDB

### Client-side
- Angular, Bootstrap, FlatUI(?)

## Numerical Data
- Times of snacking per day
- Calorie count per snack
